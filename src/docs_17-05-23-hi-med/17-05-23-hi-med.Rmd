1. Background on small-area estimation of HIV indicators
2. Estimating HIV risk group proportions
3. Is this something you might want to work on?

# 1. Background on small-area estimation of HIV indicators

# 2. Estimating HIV risk group proportions

## Background

::: columns

:::: column

* In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-29 are 28% of the population but 44% of new infections
* This disparity is because of:
  1. Younger age at first sex
  2. Age patterns of sexual mixing
  3. Structural vulnerabilities and power imbalances
  4. Increased susceptibility to HIV infection

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "125px", fig.cap="Tweet from UNAIDS"}
knitr::include_graphics("tweet.png")
```

## Prevention packages

* There are some prevention options ("core package") cheap enough they should be provided to all AGYW 
* Other options ("intensified interventions") are more costly, and there are insufficient resources to offer to all AGYW

$\implies$ How to prioritise interventions to have the greatest impact?
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

## Stratified prevention

::: columns

:::: column

* Global AIDS strategy 2021-2026 proposed stratifying HIV prevention for AGYW based on
  1. Population-level HIV incidence
  2. Individual-level sexual risk behaviour
* These are the two most proximal drivers of sexual transmission
