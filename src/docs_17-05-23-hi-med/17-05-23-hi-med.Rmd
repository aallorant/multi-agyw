# 1. Precision public health for HIV

## What is precision public health

* In medicine, we want to deliver the right intervention, at the right time
* \textcolor{hilit}{Precision medicine} seeks to do that at the individual-level
* \textcolor{hilit}{Precision public health} seeks to do it at the population-level

> Recognizing that **"one size does not fit all"**, the Strategy prioritizes tailoring of differentiated service packages and service delivery approaches to the **unique needs of people, communities and locations**, using granular data to focus programmes most effectively.

## How can statistics help?

* \textcolor{hilit}{Granular estimates} of relevant quantities are required
* Disaggregation by \textcolor{hilit}{geography, sex, age, and behaviour}

\begin{center}
\begin{tcolorbox}[width=0.9\textwidth, colframe={title}, colback={white}, title={}]

\begin{itemize}
\item HIV prevalence: proportion of people who are infected
\item HIV incidence: rate of new infections
\item Antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage: proportion of people living with HIV who take ART
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.cap="Example population health goals."}

```

# 2. Estimating risk group proportions

##

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
cbpalette <- c("#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#E69F00", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#999999")

data.frame(
  x = c("28% of the population", "44% of new infections"),
  y = c(0.28, 0.44),
  level = c(2, 1)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = y, fill = x)) +
    geom_col() +
    coord_flip() +
    geom_text(aes(label = x, y = 0.1), colour = "white", position = "dodge", size = 5) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cbpalette) +
    labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) 15-29 are", caption = "(Across 13 AGYW priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa)") +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      axis.title.y = element_blank(),
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
    ) 
```

## Why?

1. Younger age at first sex
2. Age patterns of sexual mixing
3. Structural vulnerabilities and power imbalances
4. Increased susceptibility to HIV infection

    scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "#CC79A7")) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(10, 90), labels = c("Cheap", "Expensive"), limits = c(0, 100)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(10, 90), labels = c("Works poorly", "Works well"), limits = c(0, 100)) +

    theme(
      panel.border = element_blank(),

      axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey92", linewidth = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, "pt"), type = "open"))
    )
```

## How to prioritise interventions?

* The \textcolor{hilit}{most proximal drivers} of transmission are
$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{transmission}) \propto \text{sexual partnerships} \times \mathbb{P}(\text{each partner can transmit})
$$

##

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- y <- c(1:4)

expand.grid(x, y) %>%
  mutate(risk = ifelse(Var2 > 1, Var1 * Var2, 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = risk)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = c("white", "#E69F00"),
    breaks = c(2, 14),
    labels = c("Less risk", "More risk") 
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:4), labels = c("Low: <0.3%", "Moderate: 0.3-1%", "High: 1-3%", "Very high: >3%")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:4), labels = c("None", "Low", "High", "Very\n high")) +
  labs(x = "Population-level HIV incidence", y = "Individual-level risk behaviour", title = bquote("Important we consider" ~ bold("both") ~ "population setting and individual behaviour"), fill = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey92", linewidth = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, "pt"), type = "open"))
  )
```

## Individual-level behavioural risk

| Level       | Behavioural risk group             | Risk ratio |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| None        | Not sexually active                | 0          |
| Low         | One cohabiting partner             | 1          |
| High        | Multiple or non-regular partner(s) | 1.72       |
| Very High   | Female sex workers                 | 13         |

## What have we done

* Goal: enable \textcolor{hilit}{prioritisation} of HIV programming for AGYW
* Audience: programme managers, service providers and policy makers 
* Plan: estimate district-age-behavioural risk group proportions, HIV prevalences and HIV incidences across 13 high priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa
* Method: a Bayesian spatio-temporal model of survey data

  filter(area_level == 2) %>%
  arealutils::plot_graph(add_geography = TRUE)

``` 

## Where might this work go

* Extension to adults 15-49 and further countries
* Generation of estimates led by country teams as a part of a yearly process: data ownership, data use, and data quality

# 3. Some broader thoughts on careers

##

* Upside: could \textcolor{hilit}{influence health outcomes for many people}
* Downside: part of a (more?) complex theory of change

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(\text{impact}) = &\mathbb{P}(\text{relevant people interact with your work}) \\
&\times \mathbb{P}(\text{what you've done is useful}) \\
&\times \mathbb{P}(\text{message correctly conveyed}) \times \cdots \\
&\times \mathbb{P}(\text{intervention technically works}) \\
&\times \mathbb{P}(\text{intervention correctly implemented}) \times \cdots
\end{align*}

* How does this balance out?

## About me

* Maths undergraduate $\to$ statistics masters $\to$ statistics (and machine learning, sort of) PhD
* Involved with Effective Altruism during my masters, and since then I've been interested in impactful applications of statistics

## Applied methodology

* Being good (perhaps not great) at a useful enough collection of things
* Feeling like no one care about the application at methods conferences, and no one cares about the methods at application conferences

## Team science

* A lot of disciplines required: Epidemiology, public health, health economics, behavioural science, implementation science, mathematics, statistics, computer science, software engineering
* Academia pushes against this by wanting every contribution to be marginally interesting in each field
