## Statistical model

Fit 13 models of the form:

\begin{align}
    y_{itak}^\star &\sim \text{xPoisson}(\lambda_{itak}) \\
    \log(\lambda_{itak}) &= \beta_k + \alpha_{ak} + \phi_{ik} + \gamma_{tk} + \delta_{itk} + \theta_{ita}.
\end{align}

## Benefits of smoothing

1. Get estimates even where there isn't direct data

* Some people think of this as "making up data"
* In some sense all estimates are "made up" though
* Uncertainty should be higher in regions with infilling
* Perhaps we do a bad job communicating uncertainty, or it's just hard

## Benefits of smoothing

2. Borrow information across space, surveys, categories

* Space-category effects, survey-category effects, space-survey-category effects (using Kronecker products)
* Fun to think about what models might be reasonable for this and whether structured category effects might be interesting
  * e.g. some model for misclassification of individuals into categories could give a kind of structured category effect (currently it's IID always)
* Wonder to what extent we're oversmoothing
  * e.g. might expect to see discontunities in the data (e.g. urban centers) which we're smoothing away

## Next steps

* Feedback on paper from people who know more about country contexts
* Connect more to policy. For example by replicating Katie's "number of new infections by risk group" spreadsheet
* Add logistic regression model for proportion of non-regular partner(s) who are KP
