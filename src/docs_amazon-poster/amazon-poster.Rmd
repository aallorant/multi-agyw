## Introduction

* Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) 15-29 continue to **face disproportionately high risk** of HIV, and have been identified as a **priority population** for prevention efforts
* The UNAIDS Global AIDS Strategy 2021-2026 **recommends differentiating services** for AGYW geographically based both on individual risk behaviour and epidemic indicators
* We used a spatio-temporal model to estimate the proportion of AGYW in **four behavioural risk categories** $k = 1:4$ in 13 priority countries at a district level in the years 1999-2018

|$k$|Category                 | Risk ratio|
|:--|:------------------------|----------:|
|1  |Not sexually active      |          0|
|2  |One cohabiting partner   |          1|
|3  |Non-regular partner(s)   |       1.72|
|4  |Female sex workers (FSW) |         13|

$$\\[0.2in]$$

## Methods

* We used 47 household surveys (AIS, BAIS, DHS, PHIA)
* For the categories $k \in \{1, 2, 3^{+}\}$ we used all the data to fit a survey-weighted multinomial logistic regression via the multinomial-Poisson transformation
\begin{align}
    &y_{itak}^\star \sim \text{xPoisson}(\kappa_{itak}), \\
    &\log(\kappa_{itak}) 
    = \underbrace{\theta_{ita}}_{\text{Observation (IID)}}
    + \underbrace{\beta_k}_{\text{Category (IID)}}
    + \underbrace{\alpha_{ak}}_{\text{Age (IID)}} \\
    &+ \underbrace{\zeta_{ck}}_{\text{Country (IID)}} 
    + \underbrace{\phi_{ik}}_{\text{Spatial (Besag)}} 
    + \underbrace{\gamma_{tk}}_{\text{Temporal (AR1)}}
\end{align}
where $p_{itak} = \text{softmax}(\kappa_{ita})_k$
* To differentiate $3^{+}$ we used the 13 surveys with a transactional sex question to fit a survey-weighted logistic regression
\begin{align}
    &y_{ia4}^\star \sim \text{xBinomial} \left( y_{ia3} + y_{ia4}, p_{ia4} / (p_{ia3} + p_{ia4}) \right), \\
    &\text{logit}(p_{ia4} / (p_{ia3} + p_{ia4}))
    = \beta_0
    + \beta_\texttt{cfswever} x_c \\
    &+ \underbrace{\alpha_a}_{\text{Age (IID)}}
    + \underbrace{\zeta_c}_{\text{Country (IID)}}
    + \underbrace{\phi_i}_{\text{Spatial (Besag)}}
\end{align}
where $x_c$ is the proportion of men in each country who are clients of FSW [@hodgins2021cfsw]
* We aligned our FSW estimates to the national-level UNAIDS Key Populations Atlas [@johnston2022deriving]
* Using the Poisson formulation facilitated inference using integrated nested Laplace approximation [@rue2009approximate] via `R-INLA`
* We estimated incidence and number of new infections by risk group using the risk ratios to disaggregate Naomi model [@eaton2021naomi] general population incidence estimates

## Results

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Cloropleths showing the posterior mean of our district level estimates in 2018.'}
knitr::include_graphics("depends/3p1-continental-map.png")
```

* There is **significant variation** in risk group proportions **within and between countries**, as well as **between age groups** (but close to no change over time)
* We found a geographic delineation, with **cohabiting more common in the east** and **non-regular partner(s) more common in the south**
* Large numbers of 15-19 in Mozambique have early sexual debut and are already cohabiting

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Comparison of targeting strategies'}
knitr::include_graphics("depends/infections-reached.png")
```

* Using area, age and behavioural risk stratification **25% of new infections can be found by reaching 3% of the population**, as compared with 8% of the population when behaviour is excluded 

$$\\[0.2in]$$

## Discussion

* Using a **modular approach** allowed us to integrate all data from non-conformable surveys
* **Spatio-temporal smoothing** can be used to overcome high variance from the small sample sizes that result when further stratifying districts
* Individual behaviour is a **key determinant** of risk and providing prevention services on the basis of behavior would allow many more new infections to be reached, **especially among FSW**

### Limitations

* No adjustment for **reporting bias**
* **Risk category definitions** could be disputed
* No assessment of **practicalities or costs** of risk stratification approaches, or efficacy of available interventions

### Future work

* Inclusion of **more surveys** e.g. VACS
* Extension to **general population** of adults 15-49
