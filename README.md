# multi-agyw

Code for the project *A multinomial spatio-temporal model for sexual risk behaviour*.
This repository is an [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) project, with directories: 

* `src`: containing all reports
* `archive`: containing versioned results of running your report
* `global`: containing global data
* `data`: copies of data used in the reports
* `tutorials`: miscellaneous code used to study models etc.

## How to run and commit reports

After installing [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) (from either CRAN or Github) a report, let's say called `example`, may be run by:

`orderly::orderly_run(name = "src/example")`

The results of this run will appear in the `draft/` folder.
To commit the draft (with associated `id`) to the `archive/` folder (which should be treated as "read only") use:

`orderly::orderly_commit(id)`

Any outputs of this report will then be available to use as dependencies within other reports.

Reports can be pushed to the HIV inference group sharepoint (the remote) using:

`orderly::orderly_push_archive("example")`

Or can be pulled (alongside any dependencies) from the remote using:

`orderly_pull_archive("example")`

Alternatively, just the dependencies can be pulled using `orderly::orderly_pull_dependencies("example")`.

## To-do

### High priority

- [x] Create upper and lower credible estimates of probabilities using `inla.posterior.sample`. See the `multinomial_model` function
- Aggregate format using Kish weights and `xPoisson`, see `INLA::inla.doc("xPoisson")`
  - [x] Model 1: Age-category interaction
  - [x] Model 2: Age-category interaction, space-category intercation (IID)
  - [x] Model 3: Age-category interaction, space-category interaction (BYM2)
  - [ ] Model 4: ...
- [ ] Model comparison (DIC or WAIC) among the above models
- [ ] Create modified datasets for other (not Malawi) of the 13 priority countries. May involve generalising modifications of individual data higher in the analysis pipeline. Generalised task for `parameters: iso3`, or country by country
- Extend model to more countries (fitting separately)
- [ ] Fit a model for all DHS countries â€“ jointly

### Medium priority

- [ ] Understand how the Poisson trick interplays with different structures for multinomial model (baseline category, nested, etc.)
  - May involve 
- [ ] Possibility to include covariates
- Extend Malawi model by adding more surveys (will require more model selection)
  - [ ] DHS, requires adding time and temporal smoothing, could use survey specific intercepts
  - [ ] Adding PHIA and MICS
- Extend model to more counries (fitting jointly)

### Low priority

- [ ] Add other different types of simulated data e.g. spatial structure to `sim_sexbehav` and try to recover
- [ ] Create individual data that links the `cluster_id` to area by modifying `mwi_data_survey_behav` (currently it's only the aggregate data that is output)
- [ ] Fit model to Malawi using individual format data. Individual weighted log-likelihood in `R-INLA` might not be possible, see Google group [discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/r-inla-discussion-group/c/Q-STkrFXR0g/m/6PWxRV4tBQ). Could try `TMB`
- [ ] More detailed comparison of differences in the outcomes using `sex12m` versus `eversex` to derive `nosex`
- [ ] Add age at first sex question to help deal with `NA` entries in `eversex`

## Notes

* Biases and variation in methodology for key population data which vary by country. Survey estimates have more comparable methodology but depending on KP features (for example proportion in households included in survey sampling frame) may have varying bias. See working paper "Laga - Mapping the population size of female sex worker in countries across sub-Saharan Africa"
* Survey question "did you have sex in exchange for money or goods" has been critisied 
* The 13 AGYW Global Fund priority countries are Botswana, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, from ["The Global Fund measurement framework for adolescents girls and young women programs"](https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/8076/me_adolescentsgirlsandyoungwomenprograms_frameworkmeasurement_en.pdf)
  * Note that Botswana doesn't have DHS: instead they do their own surveys "Botswana AIDS Impact Survey (BAIS)" (this explains the lack of `src/bwa_data_survey_behav`

## Timeline

* Delivery of workbook to UNAIDS Global Fund on 17th July.
